## METRICS EXTRACTED FROM THE RESPONSE TENSORS #################################
def Time2Decay(arr, dt, fraction=0.99):
    """
    NOTE: Probably, this function will be deprecated. Replaced by others to
    identify the moment a network, node or pair-wise response reach a given
    value or reach convergence.


    The time that links, nodes or the network need to decay to zero.

    Strictly speaking, this function measures the time that the cumulative
    flow (area under the curve) needs to reach x% of the total (cumulative)
    value. Here 'x%' is controled by the optional parameter 'fraction'.
    For example, 'fraction = 0.99' means the time needed to reach 99%
    of the area under the curve, given a response curve.

    The function calculates the time-to-decay either for all pair-wise
    interactions, for the nodes or for the whole network, depending on the
    input array given.
    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N,N) flow tensor, the output 'ttd_arr' will be an
    (N,N) matrix with the ttd between every pair of nodes.
    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N) temporal flow of the N nodes, the output 'ttd_arr'
    will be an array of length N, containing the ttd of all N nodes.
    - If 'arr' is an array of length nt (total network flow over time), 'ttd_arr'
    will be a scalar, indicating the time at which the whole-network flow decays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray of adaptive shape, according to the case.
        Temporal evolution of the flow. An array of optional shapes. Either
        (nt,N,N) for the pair-wise flows, shape (nt,N,N) for the in- or output
        flows of nodes, or a 1D array of length nt for the network flow.
    timestep : real valued number.
        Sampling time-step. This has to be the time-step employed to simulate
        the temporal evolution encoded in 'arr'.
    fraction : scalar, optional
        The fraction of the total area-under-the-curve to be reached.
        For example, 'fraction = 0.99' means the time the flow needs to
        reach 99% of the area under the curve.

    Returns
    -------
    ttd_arr : ndarray of variable rank
        The time(s) taken for the flows through links, nodes or the network to
        decay. Output shape depends on input.

## RANDOMIZATION OF (WEIGHTED) NETWORKS ########################################
@jit(nopython=True)
def RandomiseWeightedNetwork1(con):
    # GORKA: This version seems to be faster, with and without Numba.
    # At least, it is never slower
    """
    Randomises a (weighted) connectivity matrix.
    The function returns a random connectivity matrix with the same number of
    links as the input matrix. The resulting connectivity has the same link
    weights of the input matrix (thus total weight is also conserved) but the
    input / output strengths of the nodes are not conserved. If 'con' is an
    unweighted adjacency matrix, the function returns an Erdos-Renyi-like
    random graph, of same size and number of links as 'con'.
    If the binarisation of 'con' is a symmetric matrix, the result will also be
    symmetric. Otherwise, if 'con' represents a directed network, the result
    will be directed.
    !!!!!!!
    GORKA: In the current version, if the underlying graph is undirected but the
    weights are asymmetric, the function won't work. The result will be a
    symmetric matrix and the total weight will likely not be conserved !!!

        Adjacency matrix of the (weighted) network.
