    The time that links, nodes or the network need to decay to zero.

    Strictly speaking, this function measures the time that the cumulative

    The function calculates the area-under-the-curve for the response curves over

    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N,N) flow tensor, the output 'totalflow' will be an
    (N,N) matrix with the accumulated flow passed between every pair of nodes.
    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N) temporal flow of the N nodes, the output 'totalflow'
    will be an array of length N, containing the accumulated flow passed through

    ----------
    arr : ndarray of adaptive shape, according to the case.
        Temporal evolution of the flow. An array of shape nt x N x N for the
        flow of the links, an array of shape N X nt for the flow of the nodes,
        or a 1-dimensional array of length nt for the network flow.
    timestep : real valued number.

        the temporal evolution encoded in 'arr'.
    timespan : string, optional
        If timespan = 'alltime', the function calculates the area under the

        If timespan = 'raise', the function calculates the area-under-the-
        curve from t0 = 0, to the time the flow(s) reach a peak value.
        If timespan = 'decay', it returns the area-under-the-curve for the
