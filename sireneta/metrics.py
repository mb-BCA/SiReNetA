    The time that links, nodes or the network need to reach maximal response.

    The function calculates the time-to-peak for either links, nodes or the

    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N,N) flow tensor, the output 'ttp_arr' will be an
    (N,N) matrix with the ttp between every pair of nodes.
    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N) temporal flow of the N nodes, the output 'ttp_arr'
    will be an array of length N, containing the ttp of all N nodes.
    - If 'arr' is an array of length nt (total network flow over time), 'ttp_arr'
    will be a scalar, indicating the time at which the whole-network flow peaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray of adaptive shape, according to the case.
        Temporal evolution of the flow. An array of optional shapes. Either
        (nt,N,N) for the pair-wise flows, shape (nt,N,N) for the in- or output
        flows of nodes, or a 1D array of length nt for the network flow.
    timestep : real valued number.
        Sampling time-step. This has to be the time-step employed to simulate
        the temporal evolution encoded in 'arr'.

    Returns
    -------
    ttp_arr : ndarray of variable rank

def AreaUnderCurve(arr, timestep, timespan='alltime'):
    """
    The amount of response accumulated over time.

    The function calculates the area-under-the-curve for the response curves over
    time. It does so for all pair-wise interactions, for the nodes or for
    the whole network, depending on the input array given.

    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N,N) flow tensor, the output 'integral' will be an
    (N,N) matrix with the accumulated flow passed between every pair of nodes.
    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N) temporal flow of the N nodes, the output 'integral'
    will be an array of length N, containing the accumulated flow passed through
    all the nodes.
    - If 'arr' is an array of length nt (total network flow over time), 'integral'
    will be a scalar, indicating the total amount of flow that went through the
    whole network.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray of adaptive shape, according to the case.
        Temporal evolution of the flow. An array of shape nt x N x N for the
        flow of the links, an array of shape N X nt for the flow of the nodes,
        or a 1-dimensional array of length nt for the network flow.
    timestep : real valued number.
        Sampling time-step. This has to be the time-step employed to simulate
        the temporal evolution encoded in 'arr'.
    timespan : string, optional
        If timespan = 'alltime', the function calculates the area under the
        curve(s) along the whole time span (nt) that 'arr' contains, from t0 = 0
        to tfinal.
        If timespan = 'raise', the function calculates the area-under-the-
        curve from t0 = 0, to the time the flow(s) reach a peak value.
        If timespan = 'decay', it returns the area-under-the-curve for the
        time spanning from the time the flow peaks, until the end of the signal.

    Returns
    -------
    integral : ndarray of variable rank
        The accumulated response (area-under-the-curve) between pairs of nodes,
        by nodes or by the whole network, over a period of time.
