Network and surrogate generation module
=======================================

Functions to construct synthetic networks and generate surrogates out of given
binary or weighted networks.

Generation and randomization of binary graphs
---------------------------------------------
These functions are imported from or inspired by the GAlib library
(https://github.com/gorkazl/pyGAlib)
Please see doctsring of module "galib.models" for a list of functions.  ::

    >>> import galib
    >>> help(galib.models)


Generator of directed weighted networks
---------------------------------------
GenRandomWeightedNet
    Generates a randomly directed network (Erdős–Rényi) with given probability
    of connection and weight distribution.

GenRandomMaskNet
    Generates a network with a given topology and random weights according to a
    given distribution.

Surrogate methods for directed weighted networks
------------------------------------------------
ShuffleWeightsFixedLinks
    Randomly re-allocates the weights associated to the links without breaking
    the network topology.

ShuffleLinks
    Randomises a connectivity matrix (links wirh weights).

    Randomises a connectivity matrix and its weights.

    Returns a random connectivity matrix (Erdos-Renyi-type) with the same number

    are conserved, but the input/output degrees of the nodes, or their individual
    strengths, are not conserved.
