def SpatialWeightSorting(con, distmat, descending=True):
    """Sorts the link weights of a network by the spatial distance between nodes.

    The function reads the weights from a connectivity matrix and re-allocates
    them according to the euclidean distance between the nodes. The sorting
    conserves the position of the links, therefore, if `con` is a binary graph,
    the function will return a copy of `con`. The distance between nodes shall
    be given as input `distmat`.

    If descending = True, the larger weigths are assigned to the links between
    closer nodes, and the smaller weights to the links between distant nodes.

    If descending = False, the larger weights are assigned to the links between
    distant nodes, and the smaller weights to links between close nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    con : ndarray (2d) of shape (N,N).
        The connectivity matrix of the network.
    distmat : ndarray, rank-2.
        A matrix containing the spatial distance between all pair of ROIs.
        This can be either the euclidean distance, the fiber length or any
        other geometric distance.
    descending : boolean, optional.
        Determines whether links weights are assigend in descending or in
        ascending order, according to the euclidean distance between the nodes.

    Returns
    -------
    newcon : ndarray of rank-2 and shape (N x N).
        Connectivity matrix with weights sorted according to spatial distance
        between the nodes.

def SpatialLatticeFromNetwork(con, distmat, descending=True):
    """Generates spatial weighted lattices with same weights as `con`.

    The function reads the weights from a connectivity matrix and generates a
    spatially embedded weighted lattice, assigning the largest weights in
    descending order to the nodes that are closer from each other. Therefore,
    it requires also the euclidean distance between the nodes is given as input.

    If `con` is a binary graph of L links, the function returns a graph with
    links between the L spatially closest pairs of nodes.

    If `descending = True`, the larger weigths are assigned to the links between
    closer nodes, and the smaller weights to the links between distant nodes.

    If `descending = False`, the larger weights are assigned to the links between
    distant nodes, and the smaller weights to links between close nodes.

    Note
    ----
    Even if `con` is either a directed network or undirected but with asymmetric
    weights, the resulting lattice will be undirected and (quasi-)symmetric
    due to the fact that the spatial distance between two nodes is symmetric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    con : ndarray (2d) of shape (N,N).
        The connectivity matrix of the network.
    distmat : ndarray, rank-2.
        A matrix containing the spatial distance between all pair of ROIs.
        This can be either the euclidean distance, the fiber length or any
        other geometric distance.
    descending : boolean, optional.
        Determines whether links weights are assigend in descending or in
        ascending order, according to the euclidean distance between the nodes.

    Returns
    -------
